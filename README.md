Here is my twitter bot - created with Python

To use:
<ol>
<li>git clone https://github.com/BeccaStaple/TwitterBot-Python.git</li>
<li>I have hidden my api keys in the Secret folder - create a new file called apiKeys.py and you can follow the template below:</li>

<br>
apiKey = ""
<br>
apiKeySecret = ""
<br>
accessToken = ""
<br>
accessTokenSecret = ""
<br>

<li>You will need to sign up on Twitter to get your own API keys: https://developer.twitter.com</li>

<li>To run: python twitter.py</li>
</ol>

Thank you https://www.youtube.com/c/DevEd for getting me started
